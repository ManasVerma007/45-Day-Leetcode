Question -

Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6

Approach -->

1. Initialize two variables max_sum and curr_sum to the first element of the input array nums[0].
2. Iterate through each element num in the nums array.
3. For each element num, update curr_sum as follows:
4. If curr_sum becomes negative, reset it to 0.
5. Add the current element num to curr_sum.
6. Update max_sum to the maximum of its current value and curr_sum.

Continue this process for all elements in the array.
After the loop, max_sum will hold the maximum sum of any subarray in nums.
