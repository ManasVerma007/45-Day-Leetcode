Problem -
A string is called a happy prefix if is a non-empty prefix which is also a suffix (excluding itself).

Given a string s, return the longest happy prefix of s. Return an empty string "" if no such prefix exists.

Example 1:

Input: s = "level"
Output: "l"
Explanation: s contains 4 prefix excluding itself ("l", "le", "lev", "leve"), and suffix ("l", "el", "vel", "evel"). The largest prefix which is also suffix is given by "l".


Approach - 

Initialize n as the length of the string s.
Set longest_common initially as an empty string.
Iterate from i = 1 to n - 1.
Extract prefix and suffix of length i from the beginning and end of s.
If prefix equals suffix, update longest_common with this common string.
Continue this loop for all possible lengths.
After the loop, longest_common holds the desired result. Return it.
