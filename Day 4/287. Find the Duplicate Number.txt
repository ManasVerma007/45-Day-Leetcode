Problem - 

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2

Approach -
Initialization:

Initialize low to 1 and high to the length of nums minus one.
Binary Search Loop:

Use a while loop to perform a binary search-like operation.
Calculate Middle Value (mid):

Calculate mid as the middle value between low and high.
Count Numbers Less Than or Equal to mid:

Count how many numbers in nums are less than or equal to mid.
Update low and high:

Update low or high based on the count:
If count <= mid, update low to mid + 1.
If count > mid, update high to mid.
Repeat Binary Search:

Continue the loop until low is no longer less than high.
Return Result:

Return the value of low as the duplicate number once low and high converge.
