Question: 

Given an array nums of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. 
You can return the answer in any order.

Approach for Generating Permutations using DFS:

Initialize an empty list to store permutations.
Use a DFS function with state, current permutation, and permutations list.
In the DFS function, check for the base case (empty state).
Iterate through elements, choose one at a time, and explore recursively.
Backtrack by removing the chosen element.
Return the list of permutations.
Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3]
Output: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
