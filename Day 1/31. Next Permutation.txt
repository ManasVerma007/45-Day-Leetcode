Question - A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.


Approach -->

Initialization: Start with two pointers, i and j, at the end of the list.

Find First Decreasing Element: Move i left until you find the first element smaller than the one next to it.

No Greater Permutation: If i becomes 0, there's no greater permutation, so reverse the list.

Swap Elements: Find the smallest element in the right sublist greater than i-1 and swap them.

Reverse Sublist: Reverse the right sublist to get the smallest permutation.
