Problem - 
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Approach - 

Create a Set: Create a set called num_set to store input numbers for fast lookups.

Initialize Variables: Set longest_streak to 0 to track the longest consecutive streak found.

Iterate Through Numbers: Loop through each number in num_set.

Check for Streak Start: If the current number is the start of a streak (previous number not in num_set), find the streak's length by incrementing current_num until a non-consecutive number is encountered.

Update Longest Streak: Update longest_streak with the maximum value between the current streak and the previous longest streak.

Return Longest Streak: After processing all numbers, return longest_streak as the length of the longest consecutive sequence.
