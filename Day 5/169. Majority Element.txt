Problem -
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3


Approach -

Initialize ans and count variables.

Initialize ans to 0 and count to 0.
Iterate through the list nums.

For each element i in the list:
Update ans and count.

If count is 0, set ans to i.
If i matches ans, increment count.
If i is different from ans, decrement count.
Return the majority element stored in ans.

After iterating through the list, ans holds the majority element.
the above process is based solely on the fact there exists a majority element that's it.
