Problem - Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Approach - 

Initialize res and reslen to store the longest palindrome and its length.

Iterate through each character in s:

For each character, expand outward to find odd-length and even-length palindromes centered at that character.
Update res and reslen if a longer palindrome is found.
Return res as the longest palindromic substring.
