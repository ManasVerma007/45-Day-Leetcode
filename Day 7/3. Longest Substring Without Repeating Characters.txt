Problem - 
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3

Approach -

We have to maintain a dictionary such that it will contain all the new characters in current iteration of the string.

When we see a repeated charcater then we update the length if(max is true) otherwise we simply delete the elements of the dictinary and repeat the process again.
